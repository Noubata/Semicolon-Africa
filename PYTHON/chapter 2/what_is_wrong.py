#(Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?) The following code should read an integer into the
#variable rating: 

rating = input('Enter an integer rating between 1 and 10')

'''This code can be printed, but the variable cannot be used as an integer, like we think. So, we need to cast it as a string before using it, because the print function only returns a string.'''
